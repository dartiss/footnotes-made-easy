# Footnotes Made Easy

<img src="https://ps.w.org/footnotes-made-easy/assets/icon-128x128.png" align="left">Footnotes Made Easy is a simple, but powerful, method of adding footnotes into your posts and pages.

**Footnotes Made Easy is a fork of [WP Footnotes](https://github.com/drzax/wp-footnotes "Github - wp-footnotes"), a plugin by Simon Elvery which was abandoned some years ago.**

Features include...

* Simple footnote insertion via double parentheses
* Combine identical notes
* Solution for paginated posts
* Suppress Footnotes on specific page types
* Option to display ‘pretty’ tooltips using jQuery
* Lots of configuration options

Creating a footnote is incredibly simple - you just need to include your footnote in double parentheses, such as this...

>This is a sentence ((and this is your footnote)).

The footnote will then appear at the bottom of your post/page.

**Important note:** Make sure you include a space before your opening double parentheses or the footnote won't work!
